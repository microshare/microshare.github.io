This tutorial is intended for non-technical people. Technical people can create branches and files in their preferred way, but they should still pay attention to the content.

The process involves creating a branch, adding/editing content, and then submitting a pull request.

To find more details about the content format, read a little about markdown format. You can also use ChatGPT to generate it for you. Additionally, you can find more details about content creation on the main readme.

## 1. Creating a Branch

1. Go to the documentation website.
