## Architecture
- The platform is built as a series of tightly coupled microservices which can be used independently to support your own offering
- The entire stack operates as JSON API REST calls, making it easy to interoperate with other systems
- Data can be stored both in our Data Lake and in any other storage on-premise or in the cloud

## Runs everywhere
- microshare™ can run as-a-service from our secure cloud
- We can run all or part of the service in your Data Center
- We can also run directly on devices

## Proven embedded
- Part of the Microshare™ platform has already successfully been integrated in other software by large publicly traded enterprise software companies
- Proven code quality through seamless integration and external audits (e.g. Black Duck)
