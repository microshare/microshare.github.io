With Data comes the need to being able to share the data with other people. But sharing with some control over your data is the key.

In Microshare, you can share your data with other people and control the access to this data through the use of Rules. Looking to learn more about Rules? Check out the [Rules Guide](https://microshare.github.io/docs/0.1/getting-started/rules-guide/).
