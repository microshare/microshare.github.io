### ST05 – Universal Contact Tracing (UCT)

The Universal Contact Tracing solution from Microshare is a complete sensing service for organizations looking to provide a safer working environment by enabling anonymous monitoring and alerting of human-to-human and human-to-location contact events within a working environment such as a factory, office or construction site.

What&#39;s in the box? The Contact Tracing solution from Microshare includes:

* `Battery-operated Bluetooth enabled wearable devices [with wristband, armband and/or lanyard attachments]`

* `Bluetooth location markers [with adhesive strips]`

* `Wave devices`

* `LoRaWAN Gateway devices`

* `Portable USB QR scanning device`

Also included with our solutions is device connectivity, direct API and streaming data access via the Microshare Smart Network.

Alongside installation of the hardware, there are data processes to setup at your side in order to implement the UCT solution from Microshare. This document covers both the data set up steps and the steps required for installation of hardware.

We recommend that the hardware is installed/activated in the following order. After the installation/activation of each device, you can email [`installation@microshare.io`](mailto:installation@microshare.io) to confirm that each component is setup and registering with the network correctly:

* `1.   LoRaWAN Gateway`

* `2.   Wave devices`

* `3.   Location markers`

* `4.   Wearable devices`

## Section 1 - Pre-installation data streaming test steps

*   Setup Streaming service to receive test data

*   Once set up, securely share your endpoint information with Microshare to allow for receipt of test data

*   Receive test streaming data and start to build artifacts to analyze the data

**Streaming Service Overview**

For Universal Contact Tracing, we provide streaming integration via multiple services. Contact Tracing data will be streamed to you via one of the services and you will be able to create dashboards, reports, and/or alerts within your own toolsets.

Streaming Integration Services:

**>** [Microsoft Azure Event Hub](http://docs.microshare.io/docs/2/technical/streaming-integration/azure-event-hub-integration/)

**>** [Microsoft Azure IoT Hub](http://docs.microshare.io/docs/2/technical/streaming-integration/azure-iot-hub-integration/)

**>** [AWS Kinesis](http://docs.microshare.io/docs/2/technical/streaming-integration/aws-kinesis-data-stream-integration/)

**>** [AWS SQS](http://docs.microshare.io/docs/2/technical/streaming-integration/aws-sqs-integration/)

**>** [Google Pub/Sub](http://docs.microshare.io/docs/2/technical/streaming-integration/google-pub-sub-integration/)

We can stream a set of UCT test data to you so that you can start to build the dashboards, reports, and/or alerts whilst waiting for the hardware to arrive and be installed. The steps below outline the general steps that can be used in conjunction with the specific stream steps above.

**Setup**

1.  Use the streaming service specific instructions to set up your test service. Provide your Microshare contact with the endpoint information requested (e.g. csv, primary connection string, private key, etc.) via a secure method

2.  Microshare will stream test data to your endpoint

3.  Create dashboards, reports, and/or alerts using the test data stream

4.  Use the streaming service specific instructions to set up your production stream. You can use the same stream previously provided to Microshare or create a new one. Provide your Microshare contact with the endpoint information requested via a secure method

5.  Once your hardware has been set up and data creation has been confirmed, Microshare will begin streaming your data to the new endpoint

## Section 2 – LoRaWAN Gateway install instructions

*   Receive shipment[s] of required hardware; LoRaWAN Gateway[s], Kerlink Wave, Location Markers and Wearable Devices

*   Set up LoRaWAN Gateways in locations as determined during the Site Checklist meeting

*   Once these steps are complete, notify Microshare on [`installation@microshare.io`](mailto:installation@microshare.io) to enable us to verify that the gateways are transmitting data with a good signal

**Installing LoRaWAN Gateways**

The LoRaWAN Indoor Gateway with 4G Backhaul from Microshare receives radio transmissions from the deployed Microshare IoT devices in and around your building and uses an integrated cellular/mobile connection to send data securely to the Microshare Smart Network.

Please make sure your selected physical install location will allow for a good cellular signal and is central to the IoT devices you will use in your facility. Contact Microshare if you have any queries on the best place to install the gateway. Bad placement will result in poor performance of the overall system.
