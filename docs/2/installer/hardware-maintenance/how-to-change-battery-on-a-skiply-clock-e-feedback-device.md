4.  Remove the five batteries

5.  With batteries removed, press any faceplate buttons multiple times.

-   this discharges any residual power on the board

    terminals

7.  Press the Manual Reset Button found at the bottom left side of the
    two batteries.

8.  The LED's will cycle through a power reset of green and red flashes,
    ending with a longer flash of red LED's

9.  At this time, the display may still appear to be blank

10. Perform a Badge-In, after which the display should be on and display
    *"Today at..."* with the current time

11. Ensure the black rubber seal is correctly tightly within the groove
    of the backplate

12. Fit the faceplate onto the backplate, ensure the seal has not moved

13. Screw in the four corner screws. **Note:** take care not to
    overtighten the screws, this can deform the brass spacers.

14. Lastly, fit and finger-tighten the four chrome screw caps

### Joining the Network

In order for the Feedback Device to join the network after a battery
replacement:

-   Press any button on the faceplate

This will send data from the device and initiate a join to the network

-   Any subsequent button press will be seen as data
