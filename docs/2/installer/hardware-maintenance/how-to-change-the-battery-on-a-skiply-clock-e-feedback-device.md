<br>
4.  Remove the five batteries

<br>
5.  With batteries removed, press any faceplate buttons multiple times.

<br>
-   this discharges any residual power on the board

<br>
6.  Insert new batteries, ensure correct orientation with + & -
    terminals

<br>
7.  Press the Manual Reset Button found at the bottom left side of the
    two batteries.

<br>
8.  The LED's will cycle through a power reset of green and red flashes,
    ending with a longer flash of red LED's

<br>
9.  At this time, the display may still appear to be blank

<br>
10. Perform a Badge-In, after which the display should be on and display
    *"Today at..."* with the current time

<br>
11. Ensure the black rubber seal is correctly tightly within the groove
    of the backplate

<br>
12. Fit the faceplate onto the backplate, ensure the seal has not moved

<br>
13. Screw in the four corner screws. **Note:** take care not to
    overtighten the screws, this can deform the brass spacers.

<br>
14. Lastly, fit and finger-tighten the four chrome screw caps

<br>

### Joining the Network

In order for the Feedback Device to join the network after a battery
replacement:

-   Press any button on the faceplate

This will send data from the device and initiate a join to the network

-   Any subsequent button press will be seen as data
