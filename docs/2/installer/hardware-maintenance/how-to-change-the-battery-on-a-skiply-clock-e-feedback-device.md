2. Use a Philips head screwdriver to remove the four screws found underneath    
   - Be careful not to lose the four brass spacers.  
  
3. Remove the front face plate    
   - Turn the device over and gently tap the back.

4. Remove the five batteries.  
  
5. With batteries removed, press any faceplate buttons multiple times.    
   - This discharges any residual power on the board.  
  
6. Insert new batteries, ensuring correct orientation with + & - terminals.  
  
7. Press the Manual Reset Button found at the bottom left side of the two batteries.

8. The LEDs will cycle through a power reset of green and red flashes, ending with a longer flash of red LEDs.  
  
9. At this time, the display may still appear to be blank.  
  
10. Perform a Badge-In, after which the display should be on and display *"Today at..."* with the current time.  
  
11. Ensure the black rubber seal is correctly tightly within the groove of the backplate.

12. Fit the faceplate onto the backplate, ensuring the seal has not moved.  
  
13. Screw in the four corner screws. **Note:** Take care not to overtighten the screws, as this can deform the brass spacers.  
  
14. Lastly, fit and finger-tighten the four chrome screw caps.  
  
### Joining the Network  
In order for the Feedback Device to join the network after a battery replacement:  
- Press any button on the faceplate.    
  This will send data from the device and initiate a join to the network.  
- Any subsequent button press will be seen as data.
