### How to Perform a Manual Reset of a TABS Open/Close Sensor  

1.  Insure that the device is located within the gateway\'s range.

2.  Use a screwdriver or similar tool to remove the battery cover from the device.

3.  Remove the battery.

4.  Use an insulated wire (with exposed ends) to briefly connect the positive and negative terminals in the device by bridging the terminals. During this process, you should see a blue LED flash.

5.  Reinsert the battery, making sure to maintain the correct polarity. Upon powering on the device, a blinking blue LED light will signify attempts to communicate with the gateway.Â
