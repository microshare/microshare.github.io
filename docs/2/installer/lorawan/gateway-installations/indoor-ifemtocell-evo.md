* Using your Microshare solutions safely  

    * Follow the stated battery requirements before installing any batteries. 

    * Never force a connector into a port. If the connector and port don’t join with reasonable ease, they probably don’t match. Make sure that the connector matches the port and that you have positioned the connector correctly in relation to the port. 

    * Protect Microshare sensors from direct sunlight, wherever possible. 

    * Use Microshare solutions in environments according to their specification. Most products are for indoor use only. 

    * There are no user-serviceable parts inside Microshare sensors. For service personnel: Always unplug external power supply, remove batteries, and turn off UPS battery before service operation. 

    * Microshare sensors may be damaged by improper storage or handling. Take care not to drop them during transport and installation.

## LoRaWAN Indoor Gateway Installation
---------------------------------------
The LoRaWAN Indoor Gateway from Microshare receives radio transmissions from the deployed Microshare IoT devices in and around your building and uses a standard Ethernet connection to your network, or alternatively the integrated cellular/mobile connection to send data securely to the Microshare Smart Network™. 

The gateway is very easy to install for either the wired or wireless methods. In both cases it is usually a case of plugging in the equipment and within a few minutes it will be up and running, with the wired option offering improved data transmission reliability. The LoRaWAN gateway is a radio device and therefore will perform better when installed away from large metallic objects and partitions.  

If using the cellular (4G) Backhaul option, optimal performance will be obtained if your selected physical installation location allows for a good cellular signal and is centrally located to the IoT devices you will use in your facility. Microshare can assist you to help you make the most of your installation. 

## What's in the box?
---------------------------------------
In terms of deploying quickly, the Indoor Gateway can be plugged into your existing network via a standard Ethernet cable to a switch or router with Internet access. Alternatively, if adding to a network is not an option the gateway is delivered pre-configured with the 4G SIM card already activated. Inside the box you will find the Indoor Gateway, the device antenna, the power supply unit and an Ethernet cable. Installation enables IoT device connectivity and access to data through the Microshare Smart Network API, or alerts and data dashboards via Microshare Business Tools™.

Microshare delivers the Kerlink iFemtocell Evolution Gateway ready for addition to your existing IT network. All you need to do to have your LoRaWAN network up and running is to: 

1. Connect the antenna.
2. Plug into a main power source.
3. Connnect to your network with an Ethernet cable and wait 1-2 minutes for the connection to be established. 

## Installation Instructions
---------------------------------------


### 1. Unboxing the gateway 
---------------------------------------
Remove all of the components from the box and remove all packaging from the devices.  The box contains Indoor Gateway(s), device antenna(s) and power supply utility(ies). 

<br>

<br>
### 4. Connecting to your network 
---------------------------------------
Plug a standard Ethernet cable with Internet access into your gateway. 

<br>

{% include image.html width=400 url="/assets/img/ifemtocell-evo/femto-evo-new2.png" description="LoRaWAN Technology" %}
<br>
After 1-2 minutes, the two LEDs on the front will turn solid green, your LoRaWAN gateway is now up and running and your sensors can be deployed in your building.

<br>
**Your all done!**
Please email `installation@microshare.io` to indicate that your gateway is up and running, so that we can confirm at our end.

#### 4A. Post Installation

In most cases when connecting to an existing network, the gateway should communicate immediately. If not, your network administrator may need to open the following Ports: 
* Protocol: OpenVPN 
* Port: 1194 UDP  
<br>
* Protocol: ICMP 
* (no port number required) 

<br>
For additional security, the 2 above protocols can be restricted to our Server’s IP address:
[https://microshare.wanesy.com/](https://microshare.wanesy.com/) 
You may also want to deploy our gateways on a dedicated VLAN for additional separation from your network. 

#### 4B. Installing your gateway using the preconfigured 4G backhaul option

As an alternative to deploying the Indoor Gateway on your existing network, Microshare delivers the Kerlink iFemtocell Evolution pre-configured with a 4G SIM card already activated. Be aware that certain applications such as Contact Tracing and Asset zoning require a very strong connection to the Internet and may not operate properly if 4G signal is not adequate where you install the gateway. 

If using 4G, simply follow these steps: 

1. Connect the antenna 
2. Plug into a mains power source  
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for the SIM card connection to be established and the 2 LED’s will turn solid green to show connection is made. 

**You’re all done!**  

Please email `Installation@microshare.io` to indicate your gateway is up and running, so that we can confirm at our end. 


### Gateway appears offline - troubleshooting
---------------------------------------

1) Check the device is still installed at the set location 

2) Are there two solid green lights on the gateway?
* If there are no lights, please check that the gateway is still connected to the mains via the cable provided. 
* If there is one solid green and another flashing green or is solid red, that means the device is not connected to the network.
     <br> -If using cellular connectivity, check the SIM card is inserted properly (this can be found at the bottom of the device) 
     <br> -If using Ethernet, check the ethernet cable is connected both to the gateway and to the router
* If there are no lights, please check that the gateway is still connected to the mains via the cable provided. 

3) You will know the issue has been resolved when there are two solid green lights on the device

4) If you are still experiencing issues – please contact our 24hr Support team at `support@microshare.io`
