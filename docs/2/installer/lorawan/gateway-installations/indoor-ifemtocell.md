## Setting up the Kerlink iFemtocell
---------------------------------------

The Kerlink iFemtocell receives radio transmissions from the Microshare® IoT devices in and around your building and uses an integrated Ethernet or cellular/mobile connection to send data securely to the Microshare® Smart Network.
Please make sure your selected physical install location will allow for a good cellular signal and is central to the IoT devices you will use in your facility. Contact Microshare® if you have any doubts on the best place to install the gateway. Bad placement will result in poor performance of the overall system.

Microshare® delivers Kerlink iFemtocells pre-configured and if required with a 4G USB dongle already activated.
All you need to do to have your LoRaWAN network up and running is to :
Re-assemble the parts
Plug into a mains power source and wait for the connection to be established
