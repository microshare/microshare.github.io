## Setting up the Kerlink iFemtocell
---------------------------------------

The Kerlink iFemtocell receives radio transmissions from the Microshare IoT devices in and around your building and uses an integrated Ethernet or cellular/mobile connection to send data securely to the Microshare Smart Network.
Please make sure your selected physical install location will allow for a good cellular signal and is central to the IoT devices you will use in your facility. Contact Microshare if you have any doubts on the best place to install the gateway. Bad placement will result in poor performance of the overall system.

Microshare delivers Kerlink iFemtocells pre-configured and if required with a 4G USB dongle already activated.
All you need to do to have your LoRaWAN network up and running is to:
<br>
**1.** Re-assemble the parts
<br>
**2.** Plug into a mains power source and wait for the connection to be established

The indoor gateways are powered using a 12VDC AC/DC power supply with a 5.5mmx2.5mm socket.
Kerlink Waves are powered by standard Micro-USB 5V power. The power source should have a voltage between 4.75V DC and 5.25V DC, and a current between 1A and 3A.

###### Step 2

<br> **If using an external 4G dongle,** Insert the 4G dongle to the USB port on the other side of the iFemtocell. You may need to gently force the dongle to go all the way in.
<br> **If using Ethernet,** Insert a standard Ethernet cable with a RJ45 connector into the appropriate port on the side of the iFemtocell.

###### Step 4
* Plug the power adapter into a mains power socket.

You’re all done! Please send an email to `support@microshare.io` to indicate the Gateway is up and running so we can confirm at our end.


### Gateway appears offline - troubleshooting
---------------------------------------

1) Check the device is still installed at the set location 

2) Are there two solid green lights on the gateway?
* If there are no lights, please check that the gateway is still connected to the mains via the cable provided. 
* If there is one solid green and another flashing green or is solid red, that means the device is not connected to the network.
     <br> -If using cellular connectivity, check the SIM card is inserted properly (this can be found at the bottom of the device) 
     <br> -If using Ethernet, check the ethernet cable is connected both to the gateway and to the router
* If there are no lights, please check that the gateway is still connected to the mains via the cable provided. 

3) You will know the issue has been resolved when there are two solid green lights on the device

4) If you are still experiencing issues – please contact our 24hr Support team at `support@microshare.io`
