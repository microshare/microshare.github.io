### A. Development or Production

Microshare® consists of two environments, the development environment and the production environment; each has its own characterisitics and fufill different needs. 

Dev : [dapp.microshare.io](https://dapp.microshare.io/login)

Prod : [app.microshare.io](https://app.microshare.io/login)

Here is the table of the different reasons to create an account on the dev or production environment.


| Dev                   | Prod                      |
| -----------------     |:---------------------    :|
| Demo Dashboards       | General customer account  |
| Demo APIs             | Long term data backup     |
| Tests                 |                           |
| Dashboards Creation   |                           |


To summarize, if Microshare® invites you to create an account to access your dashboard you will need to create an account on prod. While if you just want to try something go to dev.
