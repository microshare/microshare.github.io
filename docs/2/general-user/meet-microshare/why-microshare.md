## Why Microshare?

Billions of new devices are coming online every year generating zettabytes of new data. How will you enable selective, timely and controlled sharing of that data while maintaining integrity, privacy and security?

## Data Manipulation

###### Store it
From Bluetooth to LoRa to Zigbee, we bring together IoT data from all sources and sensors.

###### Enrich it
Add on-premise or cloud data with our APIData universal connectors.

###### Process it
Use our APIFlow process engine to automate data and work.

###### Microshare it
Allow access to only the parties you want.
