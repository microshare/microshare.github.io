### The latest update to the Microshare® documentation is out!

Version 2 has a new and fresh look, aiming to streamline your access to references you need by separating the identity of the user. The update brings more tutorials and explanations about the  Microshare® tools and compatible services. Become familiar with the Microshare® Platform with video tutorials presented by our development team. 

Additionally, the update brings new guides to cover more areas of what Microshare® does. Guides have been updated as Microshare® improves their process behind the scenes.   

Ready to start? See what Microshare® is all about in the [Meet Microshare Page](/docs/2/general-user/meet-microshare/why-microshare/).
