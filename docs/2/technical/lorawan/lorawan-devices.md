## 1. Introduction
---------------------------------------
Microshare's Smart Facilities solutions are powered by devices that quickly and effectively deliver data to your dashboard. From Predictive Cleaning to Environment Monitoring, Microshare provides boundless opportunities to syncronize you and your data. 

LoRaWAN devices offer a more effiecient solution to communicate data than cellular or WiFi. Sending information via Lora, the range of communication increases to hundreds of square kilometers. The power efficiency of LoRa devices far exceed their WiFi or cellular counterparts, giving a battery life of your devices up to five years. 

Microshare sets up your solution before it arrives to your door, giving you a plug-n-play experience. The following are the types of devices that you will become familiar with working with Microshare.

## 2. Types of Devices
---------------------------------------

### A. Motion Devices

Motion devices have a variety of applications throughout you environment. Motion devices have been used to provide desk occupancy, room occupancy, smart parking, predictive cleaning and activity level monitoring solutions. 

### B. Temperature and Humidity Devices

Microshare works with both indoor and outdoor specific devices which monitor environmental changes to various locations. Temperature and humidity devices are applied in indoor air quality monitoring, environment monitoring, fridge monitoring and legionella prevention solutions. 

### C. Feedback Devices

Feedback devices allow you to collect realtime responses from your target audience, and are used in feedback stations and smart timecard solutions.

### D. Water Leakage

The water leakage solution detects and alerts facilities managers of a potential major issue. Using a small probe, devices can be conveniently placed in areas at risk.

### E. Ambient Light

The ambient light device allows you to moniter light intensity throughout various rooms in your facility and is applied in the brightness and envirnonment monitoring solutions. 

### F. Waste Management

The waste management device detects and predicts an overflowing trash bin, improving cleaniness of facilities and improving predictibility of collection routes. 

## 3. Devices Microshare Uses
---------------------------------------

Microshare works with various models of LoRaWAN devices to deliver a versitile platform of data collection and management. 

### A. Browan Devices

Microshare employs Browan devices for indoor monitoring solutions.
