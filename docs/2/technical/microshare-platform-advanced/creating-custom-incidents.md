## 1. Microshare alerts
---------------------------------------

In the Microshare data pipeline, we process our IoT data (from sensors) into events and alerts, leading to a more responsive system where motion and environmental data are transformed into alerts and action data.

Alert data is the end of the process in the basic IoT pipeline, leading to a notification, a text message, or an email and leaving the customer to decide what to do next.



## 2. Overview
---------------------------------------

Alerts are primarily triggered by data streaming from a sensor. There might arise a necessity where we need to create custom alerts that are not associated with any sensor or sensor location, i.e. manually. These alerts can trigger an incident which can be acted upon by the customer.

Currently, alerts for a routing app are generated from a certain event generated by a sensor or the customer can create alerts associated to a sensor location. There yet isn't a facility for customers to create custom alerts which are not associated to any sensor location.

To create custom alerts not associated with a sensor, we can use postman to create a new share in a rectype. 
To get started with microshare's API interface, refer to the [Quick Start](https://docs.microshare.io/docs/2/technical/api/quick-start/) and [Authentication](https://docs.microshare.io/docs/2/technical/api/authentication/) guides.

## 3. Create Share API for alert
---------------------------------------

In the microshare collection that you would have setup, select the "Create One Share" request. Under path variables, set the value for rectype as the rectype for the type of event alert you wish to create.

for eg. io.microshare.event.alert
{% include image.html url="/assets/img/incidents/image1.png" description="thumbnail 1" %}

Next, in the Body tab of the request, select the raw format for the body, and write the body for the alert you wish to create in the format given below.
{ 
  "alert": "<alert_type>", 
  "change": 1, 
  "current": { 
    "sum": 1 
  }, 
  "event": "<event_type>", 
  "history": { 
    "sum": 0 
  }, 
  "label": "<label>", 
  "meta": { 
    "device": [ 
      "<location>"
    ], 
    "global": [ 
      "<organisation>"
    ], 
    "iot": { 
        "time": "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.000Z",    
    }, 
    "source": [], 
    "usecase": "SF01" 
  }, 
  "solution": "<solution_type>" 
} 

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/incidents/image2.png" description="thumbnail 2" %}

## 4. Verify Alert Creation
---------------------------------------
When you create one share of the new alert on the alert rectype, you will get a confirmation response body like so
{% include image.html url="/assets/img/incidents/image3.png" description="thumbnail 3" %}

From this body, copy the url field. Next, open the "Get One Share" request and replace the selected part with the url you copied before
{% include image.html url="/assets/img/incidents/image4.png" description="thumbnail 4" %}

Now hit send. You should see a response body like shown below, which should contain the body of the alert you created. 
{% include image.html url="/assets/img/incidents/image5.png" description="thumbnail 5" %}

With this you can verify if your share has been created correctly, After a while, your new alert should be reflected in your routing app and this can be assigned to the respective personnel.
