## 1. Introduction
---------------------------------------

You will use the Microshare API to set up your interactions with the Microshare platform through requests. The API is the destination of your devices’ data and is the main form of communication with the Microshare platform. This guide will walk you through setting up the Postman software to interact with the API and start operating with the Microshare platform.

**<!> Be careful, Microshare gives access to two of its environments (Dev and Production) be sure to use the right environments for all steps according to your needs. <!>**

If you are not sure which environment you should use, this [part](/docs/2/general/quick-start/create-an-account/#a-development-or-production) of the "Create an account" page explains why you should use Dev or Production. [Development or Production](/docs/2/general/quick-start/create-an-account/#a-development-or-production)

## 2. Get an API key
---------------------------------------

First and foremost, you will need to request an API key for authentication with the services. Afterword, you can then use the Microshare Share API to read data from, as well as write data to the platform.

* Log into your 

Production : [Microshare account.](https://app.microshare.io)
Dev : [Microshare account.](https://dapp.microshare.io)

* Go to `Manage -> Keys.`  

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/create-apikey-1.png" description="Manage -> Keys page" %}

<br>
* Click `CREATE NEW APP` and give a friendly name to your APIkey (why not "My first IoT App"?).

<br>
{% include image.html url="/assets/img/create-apikey-4.png" description="Add an App" %}

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/create-apikey-2.png" description="Add an App" %}

<br>
* Once the key is created, copy it somewhere handy, you will need it to execute Microshare API calls.

## 3. Setup Postman
---------------------------------------

### a. Microshare Environment

In the following tutorials about the API, the environment might not be the one you should use depending on your needs. 

Indeed you can use the **Development** or **Production** Environment

If you are not sure which environment you should use, this [part](/docs/2/general/quick-start/create-an-account/#a-development-or-production) of the "Create an account" page explains why you should use Dev or Production. [Development or Production](/docs/2/general/quick-start/create-an-account/#a-development-or-production)

We will show you how to set up an environment in the next part, however we need you to understand what's the difference between both environment.

> If you are on **Production**  

The environment on Postman should be like this : 

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/api/prod_environment.png" description="Empty Postman environment" width=500 %}

* authHostname : _https://auth.microshare.io_

* hostname : _https://api.microshare.io_

> If you are on **Dev**  

The environment on Postman should be like this : 

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/api/dev_environment.png" description="Empty Postman environment" width=500 %}

* authHostname : _https://**d**auth.microshare.io_

* hostname : _https://**d**api.microshare.io_




### b. Setup

This step is optional if you already have another way of invoking the API. In which case, visit [Microshare API doc](../api-collection) for a list of API call and move to the next section.

Otherwise, you can setup the API manager with Postman on your computer for a quick start access to Microshare API collection.


<br>
**1.** Visit our [API documentation page](../api-collection/) (preferable in another tab so that you may have both references open).

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/800c4698e3342072364c)

<br>
**2.** Click on the `Run in Postman` button to install Postman on you computer and automatically load in our Postman API collection and environment.  

**If that fails**, go to [the Postman website](https://www.getpostman.com/) to install Postman manually, then download and import the collection and environment from our [API documentation page](../api-collection/).

<br>
**3.** Open Postman on your computer. It will prompt you with a `Create New` modal, just close it.

<br>
{% include image.html url="/assets/img/configure-postman.png" description="Close Create New modal" %}

<br>
**4.**To see the Microshare Postman **collection**, click on `Collections` on the left hand pane.

<br>
{% include image.html url="/assets/img/configure-postman-2new.png" description="Collection and Environment config" %}

<br>
**5.** To configure your Microshare **environment**, select the cog icon situated at the top right of the screen.Then `Manage Environments`, then click on `microshare`.

<br>
{% include image.html url="/assets/img/create-apikey-5.png" description="Empty Postman environment" %}

<br>
**6.** In the environment configuration, paste your the API key in the apikey field, and enter your username and password in the corresponding fields. 

<br>
{% include image.html url="/assets/img/generate-pipe-token-1new.png" description="Empty Postman environment" %}
{% include image.html url="/assets/img/generate-pipe-token-2new.png" description="Filled Postman environment" %}


### c. Password in Postman

If your password contains simple characters, your token request should work correctly.

However, if your password contains any special characters (#,?,!,^,$,&,@ ...) please follow this quick fix to prevent errors.

* [On Postman Desktop](./#--on-postman-desktop)
* [On Postman Web](./#--on-postman-web)

#### - On Postman Desktop

Simply **right click on the "password"** value on the url and then **select  "EncodeURIComponent"**.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/api/encodeURI0.png" description="Empty Postman environment" width=600 %}

---------------------------------------

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/api/encodeURI1.png" description="Empty Postman environment" width=600 %}

---------------------------------------

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/api/encodeURI2.png" description="Empty Postman environment" width=600 %}

---------------------------------------

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/api/encodeURI3.png" description="Empty Postman environment" width=600 %}


Then if you retry your request it should work.

#### - On Postman Web

Simply **click on the "password"** value on the url, then **click on the three dots** and finally **select  "EncodeURIComponent"**.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/api/encodeURIweb0.png" description="Empty Postman environment" width=600 %}

---------------------------------------

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/api/encodeURIweb1.png" description="Empty Postman environment" width=600 %}

Then if you retry your request it should work.



---------------------------------------
<br>
That's it! You now have access to the Microshare API collection, and are setup to [authenticate](../authentication), [write data and read](../share-api) data with the platform.
