### Providing Client Access via Microshare to the identity

If you are the administrator of an identity you will be able to add people to that identity. To better understand managing access for other accounts you please see [Identity Admin.](../../../../../identity-admin/) 

 
### Remove Existing Users

If you are the administrator of an identity you will be able to remove people from that identity as needed. To better understand the identities you can read our [identity guide.](../../../technical/microshare-platform-advanced/identity-guide/ 

**1.** To determine user access, first log into Microshare.

<br> 
**5.** Locate the user you would like to remove from the identity from the users list displayed. Click the Remove button to right of the desired user.
