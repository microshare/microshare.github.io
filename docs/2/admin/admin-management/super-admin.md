### 1. Create the Organization
---------------------------------------
{% include image.html url="/assets/img/Org_1.png" description="Org Settings" %}

In order to create the organization, you must login with an Admin account, which only a select few have the ability to do. You must be logged into a microshare.io user account and have the "isAdmin" setting activated for the "pointdefau" identity.

1. Org Name is for the Organization & Identity Combined.   
* This is user facing text which is visible on the Microshare® platform in the User dropdown under 'Switch Identities'. 
2. Org Domain should be the official domain of the organization (typically where the corporate webpage is located). eg. Comcast.com. 
* This is required to include a valid internet extension and a valid top level domain.   
3. For example amazon.co,uk is valid, but neither co.uk nor amazon are valid. 
* Identity Identifier must be unique in the system, can be dot separated, should be lowercase. eg. Aramark.admin. 
4. Administrator email is the intended organization administrator, will "invite" the admin by sending an email to that address and [support@microshare.io]. Typically ms_admin@domain. 
5. The full identity string will be reversed domain + identity identifier so org domain 'microshare.io' + identifier 'admin' will be io.microshare.admin. 


### 2. Create the ms_admin account
