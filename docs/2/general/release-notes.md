## Release Notes for November 27, 2024

**New Features**

- n/a 

**Feature Enhancements**

Platform
- The Wizard has been updated to set the use case of gateway for all rodent solutions to GATEWAY.  This will allow DeployM to show gateway specific tag labels. 

EverSmart 
- Settings App: New Rules should default to listen for incident alerts - event: "incident_start".   
  - New notification rules are now created by default to notify the user when an "Incident" is "Created".  This means that the first time an alert (like a rodent presence prediction) occurs, the user is notified, but they will not be notified for subsequent alerts at that same location until the incident is resolved (for example, times out). 
  - Grouping multiple alerts into a single incident (where it results in a single notification) is called "bundling".  The user can instead opt to be notified when individual alerts occur by choosing "Rodent Alert" instead. 
  - In the past, users could ONLY listen for the creation of the bundled incident. This type of notification rule used to be shown in the Settings app as "Rodent Alert".  Now that we differentiate between listening to the bundled "incident" vs listening for individual alerts, we have updated the meaning of "Rodent Alert" to mean getting notified for individual alerts.  This means that in order to achieve the same functionality that our users previously experienced, we have updated all existing "Rodent Alert" rules to "Incident Created" rules.
- Routing App: After performing an action on an incident, the loading spinner is now displayed only on the incident and the rest of the Routing app remains usable while the action gets processed in the background.
- Settings App: Added an option to Settings for an Admin to be CC’d on user invitation/creation for single and bulk invites to the platform.

**Bug Fixes**

Platform
- SMS exceptions no longer cause other notifications to fail.

- EverSmart Rodent online help has been updated.

**New Features**

- n/a 

**Feature Enhancements**

Platform
- The User Creation API now allows the creation of an admin email to be CC'd on invitation emails. 
- Our /config endpoint now interprets “rules” consistently based on a combination of input of solution-type, alert-type, event-type, and locations array, factoring both asset account product default rules and at least one organizational override config record. 
- The Manage > Configs section now supports a JSON editor for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. 

EverSmart 
- Settings dashboard > Test Notifications tab has been removed pending a redesign of the feature.    

**Bug Fixes**

Platform
- Under the Manage > Devices > Registered Devices section, we now indicate the sort order of the Device ID and Location Tags columns. 
- When clicking Cancel after editing in Manage > Devices > Registered Devices, changes are properly discarded as expected.

    - users whose email begins with “root@” 
    - users whose isAdmin is true 
    - users whose roles contains “admin” 
  - If hideExitToConsoleForAdmin is set to true, then Exit to Console should ONLY be available for:  
    - users whose email ends with “@microshare.io” 
    - users whose email begins with “ms_admin@” 
    - users whose email begins with “root@”

   
- In the UI, in the “Summary” tiles on the Overview page and in Device Health, we have updated the description/naming of un-twinned devices to better reflect their status.
  - Un-twinned devices are no longer classed as “Unhealthy” by default. The devices are now described as “Unconfigured”. This will aid new users in understanding the information being displayed to them.   
  - Only devices with issues e.g. low battery will now be described as Unhealthy. 
  - These were the devices previously set-up with the "dummy" devEUI 00-00-00-00-00-00 (aka “unconfigured devices”). See in-app Help document for more details. 

**Bug Fixes**

Platform
- Identities in the Composer > Switch Org dropdown are now listed alphabetically.

- When clicking the Composer > Device Cluster > Network > Create button only a single call is made now.  This improvement has been made in order to reduce the load on the server and time on the browser to populate the drop-down.
- The API has been updated to automatically remove trailing spaces in all location tags (e.g. Loc1, Loc2, Loc3, Loc4) for devices in a Device Cluster.

EverSmart
- When refreshing an EverSmart app within the Suite app, the active page is now preserved.

– Deploy-M’s Search functionality now has the ability to search on the the data, such as a name, used in a tag field. So, for a User they could now search on a site name e.g. Gianni’s or Pizzeria to more quickly find the correct device in a device cluster.

- Improved the "purpose" string used to ask the user permission to access location data. 
- Improved usability and styling to give an improved look and feel

## Release Notes for November 20, 2023

**New Features**

The following changes have been completed to allow EverSmart Alert to meet demands for a “push button” service request. This solution is an MVP and is at an Alpha status.

- EverSmart Alert now supports One-Button alarm sources. Initially, this will be with Smilio A devices, but other hardware devices are being looked at and could be considered based on the use case.
- Any of our Smilio A devices can now be configured as a 1-button device with support for Service Requests (Push Button requests).

IoT Monitor

- We now show the faults from the Indoor Foot Traffic devices on the Overview page. This provides better visibility/awareness so that end users can more easily find and address hardware issues reported by these sensors.

**Feature Enhancements**

IoT Monitor

- Device Health no longer reports devices as “Unhealthy” when they are not visible in the UI.
- Change how IoT monitor interprets device health from Smilio A devices.
- To ensure IoT Monitor correctly shows healthy devices as healthy, Intermittency is no longer used as a metric for these devices when determining device health. We now handle Smilio device health as a special use case.
- Poor Signal to Noise ratio is no longer a primary metric for device health as some amount of weak connectivity is expected in real-world environments.

- Other minor improvements in EverSmart include:
  - Renamed field “Missing Records” as “Data Loss”
  - Renamed field “Total Records” as “Expected Records”
  - Added “Realtime” tab

Platform Authorization

- A show/eye icon has been added to the password input field on login so that end users may now choose to unmask their password when typing it.
- To improve the login screen, the Organization (Optional) field is no longer displayed on the log-in screen.
- Login UI now displays which "special characters" are allowed and properly allows/disallows special characters as indicated.

Suite App

- We've added a new menu item in the "hamburger" menu of the Suite App. "Exit to Console" is an advanced menu item that now appears at the bottom of the menu. Users can click on this link to exit directly to the Microshare Management Console with all of the usual advanced features. To return to the Suite App sandbox, users can either use the "back" functionality in their browser, or they can click on the "Dashboard" item in the top menu bar, or they can click back on the Suite App icon.
