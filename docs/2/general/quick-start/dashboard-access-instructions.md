---------------------------------------
## Ongoing access (new users):

<br>
**1.** Navigate to [https://dapp.microshare.io](https://dapp.microshare.io). We recommend saving this URL as a bookmark, adding the link to your Home Screen (i.e. Android, iOS) or pinning to your start screen (i.e. Windows) on your phone for future use. 

<br>
**2.** **Logging In:** Log in using your credentials. 

<br>
**3.** **Logging Out:** To log out, navigate to the Consule screen ([https://dapp.microshare.io](https://dapp.microshare.io)), click on the profile icon in the top right corner ans select Logout. 

---------------------------------------

## Key Troubleshooting Notes:

<br>
* If you can see the dashboards but are having trouble seeing any data, log out and then log back into the dashboards. 
* If you are having problems accessing the dashboards, try switching browser. Currently our platform performs best on Safari, Google Chrome and Firefox. 
* If you cannot see any dashboards, follow the <em>Switching Identities</em> instructions below.
* If you do not set up your password within the 15-minute expiration window, navigate to [https://dapp.microshare.io](https://dapp.microshare.io) and click on the “Forgot Password?” link to reset your password.  You will need to set up your password within 15 minutes of clicking on the link or click on this link again to generate a new email. 
* Contact `support@microshare.io` with any questions or issues logging into the system.
