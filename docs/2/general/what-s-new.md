### The latest update to the Microshare documentation is out!

Version 2 has a fresh new look, aiming to streamline your access to references you need by separating the identity of the user. The update brings more tutorials and explanations about the  Microshare tools and compatible services. Become familiar with the Microshare Platform with video tutorials presented by our team. 

Additionally, the update brings new guides to cover more areas of what Microshare does. Guides have been updated as Microshare improves their process behind the scenes.   

Ready to start? See what Microshare is all about in the [Meet Microshare Page](/docs/2/general/meet-microshare/why-microshare/).
