## Introduction
---------------------------------------

If you want to understand how works React-M, take a look at our page describing how it works :
[https://docs.microshare.io/docs/2/general/reactm-user-guide/](https://docs.microshare.io/docs/2/general/reactm-user-guide/)



## Creating a Task
---------------------------------------

1. The data triggered task will be generated by our robot system that analyse the data and trigger new tasks depending on parameters. 
To do so, you need to have the solution set up by microshare, as part of our ALPHA, BETA solution or product.

2. Create your own tasks : 

You can create your own tasks through API. 

## Api
---------------------------------------

To follow these explaination you must have go through our API explanations first : 
[https://docs.microshare.io/docs/2/technical/api/quick-start/](https://docs.microshare.io/docs/2/technical/api/quick-start/)

To use the api for our ToDo, here are the details : 

**URL : {{wfhostname}}/processes/TODO?Authorization={{sessionKey}}**

**replace {{value}} by the corresponding value**

wfhostname is the same as the tutorial set up. For the sessionKey, 
while you do your authentication you should see in the response the session key.
